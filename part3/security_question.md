## System Security

As the Head of Engineering for this innovative startup, the security audit will focus on the following key components:

- **Mobile and Web Frontend:**
  - **Injection Prevention:** Implement robust input validation for both the mobile and web frontend to prevent any form of code injection. Ensure data is sanitized before interacting with the backend.

- **MySQL Database:**
  - **Sensitive Data Exposure Mitigation:** Encrypt sensitive data, especially customer passwords, using secure encryption algorithms. Avoid storing passwords in plain text and ensure the database has appropriate access controls.

- **Python Backend (FastAPI):**
  - **Authentication Reinforcement:** Enforce strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, especially for the 12 software engineers with full access.

- **Access Control Strategies:**
  - **Broken Access Control Mitigation:** Establish a solid session strategy using tokens or JWTs. Ensure endpoints in the backend are protected with appropriate permissions and roles to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Third-Party Components:**
  - **Vulnerability Management:** Regularly monitor and update third-party libraries used in the web frontend, mobile app, and backend. Keep them up-to-date with stable versions to mitigate vulnerabilities.

- **Logging and Monitoring:**
  - **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring Resolution:** Implement a robust logging strategy in the backend to accurately record executions and errors. This enhances visibility and aids in the timely detection of security incidents.
